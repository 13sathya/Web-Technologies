        <h1>Hostel</h1>
        <p>Our belief that a residential campus offers a superior environment for academics turned into a reality during 2009-10. Excellent and facilitative provision of Hostel accommodation is a major support service offered by CVR College of Engineering. Moving away from home to study is an exciting time in life. There are new friends to be made, new places to discover, new chances to be explored. Every effort has been made at the Hostel to provide the best facilities for students who live on campus. Every student has access to a wide range of activities, facilities and support. The capacity of the two boys' hostels and two girls' hostels combined is 1115 in the academic year 2021-22.</p>
